        <h2>Quick History of Ranma</h2>
        <p>Ranma ½ (らんま½, Ranma Nibun-no-Ichi, pronounced Ranma One-Half in English) is a Japanese manga series created by Rumiko Takahashi. It began publication in September 1987, appearing in Shōnen Sunday after the ending of Rumiko Takahashi's previous major work, Urusei Yatsura. From September 1987 until March 1996, Ranma ½ was published on a near weekly basis with the occasional colorized page to spruce up the usually black and white manga stories. After nearly a decade of storylines, the final chapter was published in Shōnen Sunday 1996, Volume 12, finalizing the manga with a total of 115 story arcs. </p>

        <h2>What's it all about?</h2>
        <p>Glad you asked! Basically, the story revolves around a 16-year-old boy named Ranma Saotome who was trained from early childhood in martial arts. As a result of an accident during a training journey in China, he is cursed to become a girl when splashed with cold water, but hot water will change him back into a boy. What ensues is a plethora of hilarious shenanigans that have to do with Ranma's unique condition, as well as the marriage that him and Akane Tendo of the Tendo Dojo have been forcefully put in. If you've seen even one episode of the series, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about. And if not....what are you waiting for! </p>
